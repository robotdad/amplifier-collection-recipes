# Recipe Schema Reference

**Complete YAML specification for Amplifier recipes**

This document defines the complete schema for recipe YAML files. Every field, constraint, and behavior is documented here.

## Overview

Recipes are declarative YAML specifications that define multi-step agent workflows. The tool-recipes module parses and executes these specifications.

**Schema Version:** 1.3.0

## Top-Level Structure

```yaml
name: string                    # Required
description: string             # Required
version: string                 # Required (semver format)
author: string                  # Optional
created: ISO8601 datetime       # Optional
updated: ISO8601 datetime       # Optional
tags: list[string]             # Optional
context: dict                   # Optional - Initial context variables
recursion: RecursionConfig      # Optional - Recursion protection limits
steps: list[Step]              # Required - At least one step
```

### Top-Level Fields

#### `name` (required)

**Type:** string
**Constraints:**
- Must be unique within your recipe library
- Alphanumeric, hyphens, underscores only
- Max length: 100 characters

**Purpose:** Identifies the recipe in logs and UI.

**Examples:**
```yaml
name: "code-review-flow"
name: "dependency-upgrade"
name: "test-generation-pipeline"
```

#### `description` (required)

**Type:** string
**Constraints:**
- Max length: 500 characters
- Should be a single paragraph

**Purpose:** Human-readable explanation of what the recipe does.

**Examples:**
```yaml
description: "Multi-stage code review with analysis, feedback, and validation"
description: "Systematic dependency upgrade with audit, planning, and validation"
```

#### `version` (required)

**Type:** string (semantic versioning)
**Constraints:**
- Must follow semver: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (no pre-release tags)
- Example: `1.0.0`, `2.3.1`, `0.1.0`

**Purpose:** Track recipe evolution and compatibility.

**Breaking change semantics:**
- MAJOR: Incompatible changes (different inputs/outputs)
- MINOR: Backward-compatible additions (new optional steps)
- PATCH: Bug fixes, documentation updates

**Examples:**
```yaml
version: "1.0.0"
version: "2.1.3"
version: "0.5.0"
```

#### `author` (optional)

**Type:** string
**Purpose:** Credit recipe creator.

**Examples:**
```yaml
author: "Jane Doe <jane@example.com>"
author: "DevOps Team"
```

#### `created` (optional)

**Type:** ISO8601 datetime string
**Purpose:** Track recipe creation date.

**Examples:**
```yaml
created: "2025-11-18T14:30:00Z"
created: "2025-11-18T14:30:00-08:00"
```

#### `updated` (optional)

**Type:** ISO8601 datetime string
**Purpose:** Track last modification date.

**Examples:**
```yaml
updated: "2025-11-20T09:15:00Z"
```

#### `tags` (optional)

**Type:** list of strings
**Purpose:** Categorize recipes for discovery.

**Examples:**
```yaml
tags: ["code-quality", "analysis", "python"]
tags: ["security", "audit", "dependencies"]
tags: ["documentation", "improvement"]
```

#### `context` (optional)

**Type:** dictionary (string keys, any values)
**Purpose:** Define initial context variables available to all steps.

**Examples:**
```yaml
context:
  project_name: "my-app"
  target_version: "3.11"
  severity_threshold: "high"
```

**Usage in steps:**
```yaml
steps:
  - id: "analyze"
    prompt: "Analyze {{project_name}} for Python {{target_version}} compatibility"
```

#### `recursion` (optional)

**Type:** RecursionConfig object
**Purpose:** Configure recursion protection limits for recipe composition.

**Structure:**
```yaml
recursion:
  max_depth: integer      # Default: 5, range: 1-20
  max_total_steps: integer # Default: 100, range: 1-1000
```

**Fields:**
- `max_depth`: Maximum nesting depth for recipe-calling-recipe chains. Prevents infinite recursion.
- `max_total_steps`: Maximum total steps across all nested recipe executions. Prevents runaway workflows.

**Examples:**
```yaml
# Allow deeper nesting for complex orchestration
recursion:
  max_depth: 10
  max_total_steps: 200

# Strict limits for controlled workflows
recursion:
  max_depth: 3
  max_total_steps: 50
```

**Behavior:**
- Limits apply to entire recipe execution tree
- Exceeding limits raises error immediately
- Child recipes inherit limits unless overridden at step level

#### `steps` (required for flat mode)

**Type:** list of Step objects
**Constraints:**
- At least one step required
- Step IDs must be unique within recipe
- Steps execute in order

**Purpose:** Define the workflow in flat mode (sequential steps without approval gates).

**Note:** Recipes must use EITHER `steps` (flat mode) OR `stages` (staged mode with approval gates), not both.

#### `stages` (required for staged mode)

**Type:** list of Stage objects
**Constraints:**
- At least one stage required
- Stage names must be unique within recipe
- Stages execute in order
- Each stage can have an approval gate

**Purpose:** Define the workflow in staged mode with optional approval gates between stages.

**Note:** Recipes must use EITHER `steps` (flat mode) OR `stages` (staged mode with approval gates), not both.

---

## Recipe Modes: Flat vs Staged

Recipes support two execution modes. You must choose one mode per recipe - they cannot be mixed.

### Flat Mode (Sequential Steps)

**When to use:**
- Simple workflows without human checkpoints
- Automated processes that should run without interruption
- Development and testing scenarios

**Structure:**
```yaml
name: "simple-workflow"
version: "1.0.0"
description: "Sequential processing without approval gates"

steps:
  - id: "analyze"
    agent: "analyzer"
    prompt: "Analyze {{input}}"
    output: "analysis"
  
  - id: "process"
    agent: "processor"
    prompt: "Process {{analysis}}"
    output: "result"
```

**Characteristics:**
- Steps execute sequentially
- No human intervention required
- Fails fast on errors
- Resume from last successful step on interruption

### Staged Mode (Multi-Stage with Approval Gates)

**When to use:**
- High-stakes operations requiring human oversight
- Workflows where you want to review results before continuing
- Processes with distinct phases that need sign-off
- Situations where you might want to stop execution between phases

**Structure:**
```yaml
name: "staged-workflow"
version: "2.0.0"
description: "Multi-stage process with approval gates"

stages:
  - name: "planning"
    steps:
      - id: "analyze"
        agent: "analyzer"
        prompt: "Analyze {{input}}"
        output: "analysis"
    approval:
      required: true
      prompt: "Review analysis before proceeding to execution?"
      timeout: 3600  # 1 hour
      default: "deny"
  
  - name: "execution"
    steps:
      - id: "execute"
        agent: "executor"
        prompt: "Execute based on {{analysis}}"
        output: "result"
```

**Characteristics:**
- Stages execute sequentially
- Optional approval gates between stages
- Execution pauses at approval gates
- Resume after approval/denial via separate commands
- All steps within a stage execute together

### Approval Gates

Approval gates provide human-in-loop checkpoints between stages.

**Configuration:**
```yaml
approval:
  required: boolean       # Whether approval is needed (default: false)
  prompt: string         # Message shown to user
  timeout: integer       # Seconds to wait (0 = wait forever)
  default: string        # "approve" or "deny" on timeout (default: "deny")
```

**Workflow:**

1. **Stage completes** → Recipe pauses at approval gate
2. **Tool returns status:** `paused_for_approval` with session_id and stage_name
3. **User reviews** → Decides to approve or deny
4. **User approves/denies:**
   ```bash
   # Approve and continue
   amplifier run "approve recipe session <session-id> stage <stage-name>"
   
   # Deny and stop
   amplifier run "deny recipe session <session-id> stage <stage-name>"
   ```
5. **Resume execution:**
   ```bash
   amplifier run "resume recipe session <session-id>"
   ```

**List pending approvals:**
```bash
amplifier run "list pending approvals"
```

**Example with timeout:**
```yaml
approval:
  required: true
  prompt: "Review security audit results. Critical findings require immediate action."
  timeout: 7200  # 2 hours
  default: "deny"  # Auto-deny if no response
```

### Choosing Between Modes

| Consideration | Flat Mode | Staged Mode |
|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| Human oversight needed? | No | Yes |
| Can pause between phases? | No (only on error) | Yes (approval gates) |
| Complexity | Simple | More complex |
| Use case | Automation, development | Production, high-stakes ops |
| Resume behavior | Resume from failed step | Resume after approval |

**Migration path:**
- Start with flat mode for simplicity
- Upgrade to staged mode when human oversight becomes necessary
- Version bump: Changing from flat to staged is a breaking change (major version)

---

## Stage Object

A Stage groups multiple steps together with an optional approval gate. Stages are only used in staged mode recipes.

```yaml
- name: string                  # Required - Unique stage name
  steps: list[Step]            # Required - At least one step
  approval: ApprovalConfig     # Optional - Approval gate configuration
```

### Stage Fields

#### `name` (required)

**Type:** string
**Constraints:**
- Must be unique within recipe
- Alphanumeric with hyphens, underscores, and spaces allowed
- Max length: 100 characters

**Purpose:** Identifies the stage in logs, UI, and approval operations.

**Examples:**
```yaml
- name: "planning"
- name: "security-review"
- name: "Phase 1: Critical Fixes"
```

#### `steps` (required)

**Type:** list of Step objects
**Constraints:**
- At least one step required
- Step IDs must be unique across ALL stages in recipe
- Steps within stage execute sequentially

**Purpose:** Define the work performed in this stage.

#### `approval` (optional)

**Type:** ApprovalConfig object

**Purpose:** Define an approval gate that pauses execution after this stage completes.

**Structure:**
```yaml
approval:
  required: boolean       # Default: false
  prompt: string         # Required if required=true
  timeout: integer       # Seconds, 0=forever (default: 0)
  default: string        # "approve" or "deny" (default: "deny")
```

**Behavior:**
- If `required: false` or omitted, stage completes without pausing
- If `required: true`, execution pauses after stage and waits for approval
- User must explicitly approve or deny to continue
- On timeout, applies `default` action

**Example:**
```yaml
- name: "analysis"
  steps:
    - id: "audit"
      agent: "auditor"
      prompt: "Audit security"
      output: "findings"
  approval:
    required: true
    prompt: |
      Security audit complete. Review findings before proceeding:
      {{findings}}
      
      Approve to continue with fixes.
    timeout: 3600
    default: "deny"
```

**See also:** [Approval Gates](#approval-gates) for complete workflow details.

---

## Step Object

Each step represents one unit of work in the workflow. Steps can be agent invocations (default) or recipe compositions.

```yaml
- id: string                    # Required - Unique within recipe
  type: string                  # Optional - "agent" (default) or "recipe"

  # For agent steps (type: "agent"):
  agent: string                 # Required for agent steps - Agent name
  mode: string                  # Optional - Agent mode (if agent supports)
  prompt: string                # Required for agent steps - Prompt template

  # For recipe steps (type: "recipe"):
  recipe: string                # Required for recipe steps - Path to sub-recipe
  context: dict                 # Optional - Context to pass to sub-recipe

  # Common fields:
  condition: string             # Optional - Expression that must evaluate to true
  foreach: string               # Optional - Variable containing list to iterate
  as: string                    # Optional - Loop variable name (default: "item")
  collect: string               # Optional - Variable to collect all iteration results
  max_iterations: integer       # Optional - Safety limit (default: 100)
  output: string                # Optional - Variable name for step result
  agent_config: dict            # Optional - Override agent configuration
  timeout: integer              # Optional - Max execution time (seconds)
  retry: dict                   # Optional - Retry configuration
  on_error: string              # Optional - Error handling strategy
  depends_on: list[string]      # Optional - Step IDs that must complete first
```

### Step Fields

#### `id` (required)

**Type:** string
**Constraints:**
- Must be unique within recipe
- Alphanumeric, hyphens, underscores only
- Max length: 50 characters

**Purpose:** Identify step in logs, resumption, and dependency references.

**Examples:**
```yaml
- id: "analyze-code"
- id: "generate-tests"
- id: "validate-results"
```

#### `type` (optional)

**Type:** string
**Values:** `"agent"` (default), `"recipe"`
**Purpose:** Specify whether this step invokes an agent or another recipe.

**Examples:**
```yaml
# Default: agent step
- id: "analyze"
  agent: "zen-architect"
  prompt: "Analyze the code"

# Explicit agent step
- id: "review"
  type: "agent"
  agent: "code-reviewer"
  prompt: "Review the implementation"

# Recipe step (sub-workflow)
- id: "security-audit"
  type: "recipe"
  recipe: "security-audit.yaml"
  context:
    target: "{{file_path}}"
```

**Behavior:**
- `"agent"` (default): Step executes an agent with a prompt
- `"recipe"`: Step executes another recipe as a sub-workflow

See [Recipe Composition](#recipe-composition) for complete details on recipe steps.

#### `agent` (required for agent steps)

**Type:** string (agent name)
**Purpose:** Specify which agent to spawn for this step.

**Agent sources:**
- Built-in agents (installed via collections)
- Profile-defined agents (in your active profile)
- Custom agents (in `.amplifier/agents/`)

**Examples:**
```yaml
- agent: "zen-architect"
- agent: "bug-hunter"
- agent: "test-coverage"
- agent: "custom-analyzer"
```

**Validation:**
- Agent must be available when recipe executes
- Tool checks agent availability before starting recipe
- Fails fast if agent not found

#### `recipe` (required for recipe steps)

**Type:** string (recipe path)
**Purpose:** Specify which recipe to execute as a sub-workflow.

**Path resolution:**
- Relative paths resolved from current recipe's directory
- Absolute paths used as-is
- Recipe must exist and be valid

**Examples:**
```yaml
# Relative path (same directory)
- id: "security-check"
  type: "recipe"
  recipe: "security-audit.yaml"

# Relative path (subdirectory)
- id: "lint-check"
  type: "recipe"
  recipe: "checks/linting.yaml"

# Parent directory
- id: "shared-validation"
  type: "recipe"
  recipe: "../shared/validation.yaml"
```

**Validation:**
- Recipe file must exist
- Recipe must be valid (passes schema validation)
- Circular references prevented via recursion tracking

#### `context` (optional, for recipe steps)

**Type:** dictionary (string keys, any values)
**Purpose:** Pass context variables to the sub-recipe.

**Key feature:** Context isolation - sub-recipes receive ONLY the variables explicitly passed, not the parent's entire context. This prevents context poisoning and ensures predictable behavior.

**Examples:**
```yaml
# Pass specific variables
- id: "security-audit"
  type: "recipe"
  recipe: "security-audit.yaml"
  context:
    target_file: "{{file_path}}"
    severity_threshold: "high"

# Pass computed values
- id: "detailed-analysis"
  type: "recipe"
  recipe: "analysis.yaml"
  context:
    files: "{{discovered_files}}"
    previous_results: "{{initial_scan}}"

# No context (sub-recipe uses only its own defaults)
- id: "standalone-check"
  type: "recipe"
  recipe: "standalone.yaml"
```

**Behavior:**
- Variables use template syntax: `{{variable_name}}`
- Sub-recipe's `context` dict is REPLACED with passed context
- Sub-recipe's outputs available via step's `output` field
- Empty context dict `{}` passes nothing (sub-recipe uses defaults)

**Why context isolation?**
- Prevents accidental variable leakage
- Makes sub-recipes predictable and testable
- Enables recipe reuse across different contexts
- Follows principle of least privilege

#### `mode` (optional)

**Type:** string
**Purpose:** Specify how an agent should operate. Modes are agent-specific - consult each agent's documentation to see what modes it supports.

**How it works:** The mode string is prepended to the instruction as `"MODE: {mode}\n\n"` when spawning the agent. Agents that support modes will recognize this prefix and adjust their behavior accordingly.

**Example (zen-architect):**

The `developer-expertise:zen-architect` agent supports three modes:
- `ANALYZE`: For breaking down problems and designing solutions
- `ARCHITECT`: For system design and module specification
- `REVIEW`: For code quality assessment and recommendations

```yaml
- id: "design"
  agent: "developer-expertise:zen-architect"
  mode: "ARCHITECT"
  prompt: "Design a caching layer for the API"

- id: "review"
  agent: "developer-expertise:zen-architect"
  mode: "REVIEW"
  prompt: "Review the implementation for simplicity and maintainability"
```

**Important notes:**
- Not all agents support modes. If an agent doesn't recognize the MODE prefix, it will simply treat it as part of the instruction text.
- Modes are defined by each agent. See agent documentation (e.g., `@developer-expertise:agents/zen-architect.md`) for supported modes and their meanings.
- If omitted, the agent uses its default behavior.

#### `prompt` (required)

**Type:** string (template)
**Purpose:** Define what the agent should do.

**Template variables:**
- `{{variable_name}}` - Replaced with context value
- Context sources:
  - Top-level `context` dict
  - Previous step outputs (if step specified `output`)
  - Recipe metadata (`{{recipe.name}}`, `{{recipe.version}}`)

**Examples:**

Simple prompt:
```yaml
prompt: "Analyze the Python code for type safety issues"
```

With variables:
```yaml
prompt: "Analyze {{file_path}} for compatibility with Python {{target_version}}"
```

Multi-line prompt:
```yaml
prompt: |
  Review this code for security issues:

  File: {{file_path}}
  Previous analysis: {{analysis}}

  Focus on: {{focus_areas}}
```

Accessing previous step output:
```yaml
steps:
  - id: "analyze"
    prompt: "Analyze {{file_path}}"
    output: "analysis"

  - id: "improve"
    prompt: "Given this analysis: {{analysis}}, suggest improvements"
```

**Undefined variables:**
- If variable undefined, step fails with clear error
- Use `context` dict to define required variables upfront
- Check variable availability with `depends_on`

#### `condition` (optional)

**Type:** string (expression)
**Purpose:** Skip step if condition evaluates to false.

**Syntax:**
- Variable references: `{{variable}}` or `{{object.property}}`
- Comparison operators: `==`, `!=`
- Boolean operators: `and`, `or`
- String literals: `'value'` or `"value"`

**Examples:**

Simple equality:
```yaml
- id: "critical-fix"
  condition: "{{severity}} == 'critical'"
  agent: "auto-fixer"
  prompt: "Auto-fix critical issues"
```

With nested variable access:
```yaml
- id: "apply-fixes"
  condition: "{{analysis.severity}} == 'critical'"
  agent: "fixer"
  prompt: "Apply fixes for: {{analysis.issues}}"
```

Compound conditions:
```yaml
- id: "deploy"
  condition: "{{tests_passed}} == 'true' and {{review_approved}} == 'true'"
  agent: "deployer"
  prompt: "Deploy to production"
```

Alternative conditions:
```yaml
- id: "escalate"
  condition: "{{severity}} == 'critical' or {{severity}} == 'high'"
  agent: "notifier"
  prompt: "Escalate to on-call team"
```

**Behavior:**
- Condition is `true` → Execute step normally
- Condition is `false` → Skip step, continue to next
- Undefined variable in condition → **Fail recipe** with clear error
- Invalid syntax → **Fail recipe** with parse error
- Skipped step with `output` field → Output variable remains undefined

**Rationale:** Fail fast on errors. Silent skips would mask configuration problems.

See [Condition Expressions](#condition-expressions) for complete syntax reference.

#### `foreach` (optional)

**Type:** string (variable reference)
**Purpose:** Iterate over a list, executing the step once per item.

**Syntax:**
- Must contain a variable reference: `{{variable_name}}`
- Referenced variable must be a list at runtime

**Examples:**
```yaml
- id: "discover-files"
  agent: "explorer"
  prompt: "List all Python files in {{directory}}"
  output: "files"  # Returns list: ["a.py", "b.py", "c.py"]

- id: "analyze-each"
  foreach: "{{files}}"
  as: "current_file"
  agent: "analyzer"
  prompt: "Analyze {{current_file}} for issues"
  collect: "file_analyses"
```

**Behavior:**
- `foreach` variable is list → Iterate over each item
- `foreach` variable is empty list → Skip step (no error)
- `foreach` variable is not a list → **Fail recipe** with clear error
- `foreach` variable undefined → **Fail recipe** with clear error
- Exceeds `max_iterations` → **Fail recipe** with limit error
- Any iteration fails → **Fail recipe** immediately (fail-fast)

**Rationale:** Fail fast and visibly. Silent partial failures hide bugs.

See [Looping and Iteration](#looping-and-iteration) for complete syntax reference.

#### `as` (optional)

**Type:** string (variable name)
**Default:** `"item"`
**Purpose:** Name of loop variable available within the iteration.

**Constraints:**
- Must be valid variable name (alphanumeric, underscores)
- Cannot conflict with reserved names (`recipe`, `step`, `session`)

**Examples:**
```yaml
# Using default "item"
- foreach: "{{files}}"
  prompt: "Process {{item}}"

# Using custom name
- foreach: "{{files}}"
  as: "current_file"
  prompt: "Process {{current_file}}"
```

**Scope:**
- Loop variable only available within the loop step
- Not available in subsequent steps (loop-scoped)

#### `collect` (optional)

**Type:** string (variable name)
**Purpose:** Aggregate all iteration results into a list variable.

**Constraints:**
- Must be valid variable name (alphanumeric, underscores)
- Cannot conflict with reserved names (`recipe`, `step`, `session`)

**Examples:**
```yaml
- id: "analyze-each"
  foreach: "{{files}}"
  as: "file"
  prompt: "Analyze {{file}}"
  collect: "all_analyses"  # List of all iteration results

- id: "summarize"
  prompt: "Summarize these analyses: {{all_analyses}}"
```

**Behavior:**
- Collects results in order of iteration
- Available to subsequent steps after loop completes
- If `collect` omitted and `output` specified, `output` contains last iteration result only

#### `max_iterations` (optional)

**Type:** integer
**Default:** 100
**Purpose:** Safety limit to prevent runaway loops.

**Constraints:**
- Must be positive integer

**Examples:**
```yaml
# Default limit of 100
- foreach: "{{files}}"
  prompt: "Process {{item}}"

# Higher limit for large batches
- foreach: "{{large_dataset}}"
  max_iterations: 500
  prompt: "Process {{item}}"

# Lower limit for safety
- foreach: "{{untrusted_input}}"
  max_iterations: 10
  prompt: "Process {{item}}"
```

**Behavior:**
- If list length exceeds `max_iterations`, recipe fails with clear error
- Error message shows actual count vs limit

#### `output` (optional)

**Type:** string (variable name)
**Purpose:** Store step result in context for later steps.

**Constraints:**
- Must be valid variable name (alphanumeric, underscores)
- Cannot conflict with reserved names (`recipe`, `step`, `session`)

**Examples:**
```yaml
- id: "analyze"
  prompt: "Analyze code"
  output: "analysis"     # Stores result as {{analysis}}

- id: "improve"
  prompt: "Review: {{analysis}}"
  output: "improvements" # Stores as {{improvements}}
```

**Behavior:**
- If omitted, step result not stored (use for terminal steps)
- Stored results persist across session checkpoints
- Available to all subsequent steps

#### `agent_config` (optional)

**Type:** dictionary (partial agent config)
**Purpose:** Override agent configuration for this step.

**Use cases:**
- Adjust temperature for creative vs analytical steps
- Use different models for different steps
- Add step-specific tools

**Example:**
```yaml
- id: "creative-brainstorm"
  agent: "zen-architect"
  agent_config:
    providers:
      - module: "provider-anthropic"
        config:
          temperature: 0.8  # More creative than agent's default
          model: "claude-opus-4"
    tools:
      - module: "tool-web-search"  # Add web search for this step only
  prompt: "Brainstorm innovative architectures"
```

**Merge behavior:**
- Specified fields override agent defaults
- Unspecified fields inherit from agent config
- Deep merge for nested dicts (providers, tools, etc.)

#### `timeout` (optional)

**Type:** integer (seconds)
**Default:** 600 (10 minutes)
**Purpose:** Prevent hanging on unresponsive steps.

**Examples:**
```yaml
- timeout: 300   # 5 minutes
- timeout: 1800  # 30 minutes for long-running analysis
```

**Behavior:**
- If step exceeds timeout, execution cancelled
- Error logged with clear timeout message
- Recipe can resume from checkpoint (step retries)

#### `retry` (optional)

**Type:** dictionary
**Purpose:** Configure retry behavior for transient failures.

**Schema:**
```yaml
retry:
  max_attempts: integer     # Default: 3
  backoff: string          # "exponential" or "linear", default: "exponential"
  initial_delay: integer   # Seconds, default: 5
  max_delay: integer       # Seconds, default: 300
```

**Example:**
```yaml
- id: "fetch-data"
  agent: "data-fetcher"
  prompt: "Fetch latest data from API"
  retry:
    max_attempts: 5
    backoff: "exponential"
    initial_delay: 10
    max_delay: 300
```

**Retry behavior:**
- Only retries on transient errors (network, timeout, rate limit)
- Does not retry on validation errors or agent failures
- Each retry logs attempt number and delay
- Exponential backoff: delay doubles each attempt (10s, 20s, 40s, ...)

#### `on_error` (optional)

**Type:** string (error handling strategy)
**Values:**
- `"fail"` (default) - Stop recipe execution
- `"continue"` - Log error, continue to next step
- `"skip_remaining"` - Skip remaining steps, mark recipe as partial success

**Examples:**
```yaml
- id: "optional-validation"
  agent: "validator"
  prompt: "Validate results"
  on_error: "continue"  # Don't fail recipe if validation fails
```

**Use cases:**
- `"continue"`: Optional validation, non-critical steps
- `"skip_remaining"`: Guard steps that make remaining work unnecessary
- `"fail"`: Default - any failure stops recipe

#### `depends_on` (optional)

**Type:** list of strings (step IDs)
**Purpose:** Explicit dependencies between steps.

**Default behavior:**
- Steps execute in order
- Each step depends on all previous steps

**Use `depends_on` when:**
- Explicit dependency documentation
- Complex step ordering requirements

**Example:**
```yaml
steps:
  - id: "analyze-security"
    prompt: "Security analysis"
    output: "security_report"

  - id: "analyze-performance"
    prompt: "Performance analysis"
    output: "performance_report"

  - id: "generate-summary"
    depends_on: ["analyze-security", "analyze-performance"]
    prompt: "Summarize: {{security_report}} and {{performance_report}}"
```

**Validation:**
- Referenced step IDs must exist in recipe
- No circular dependencies
- Dependencies must appear before dependent step in YAML

---

## Variable Substitution

### Template Syntax

Variables use double-brace syntax: `{{variable_name}}`

### Variable Sources

Variables come from multiple sources (priority order):

1. **Step outputs** - `output` from previous steps
2. **Top-level context** - `context` dict in recipe
3. **Recipe metadata** - `recipe.*` variables
4. **Session metadata** - `session.*` variables

### Reserved Variables

Available in all steps:

```yaml
{{recipe.name}}         # Recipe name
{{recipe.version}}      # Recipe version
{{recipe.description}}  # Recipe description

{{session.id}}          # Current session ID
{{session.started}}     # Session start timestamp
{{session.project}}     # Project path (slugified)

{{step.id}}             # Current step ID
{{step.index}}          # Step number (0-based)
```

### Example

```yaml
context:
  file_path: "src/auth.py"
  severity: "high"

steps:
  - id: "analyze"
    prompt: |
      Recipe: {{recipe.name}} v{{recipe.version}}
      Session: {{session.id}}

      Analyze {{file_path}} for {{severity}}-severity issues
    output: "analysis"

  - id: "report"
    prompt: |
      Create report for:
      File: {{file_path}}
      Analysis: {{analysis}}

      Step {{step.index}} of recipe
```

### Undefined Variables

If variable undefined at runtime:
- Execution fails with clear error
- Error message shows variable name and available variables
- Session checkpointed (can fix and resume)

---

## Condition Expressions

Step conditions use a simple expression syntax for runtime evaluation.

### Syntax Overview

```
<expression> := <comparison> | <expression> "and" <expression> | <expression> "or" <expression>
<comparison> := <value> <operator> <value>
<operator>   := "==" | "!="
<value>      := <variable> | <string-literal>
<variable>   := "{{" identifier ("." identifier)* "}}"
<string>     := "'" chars "'" | '"' chars '"'
```

### Operators

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `==` | Equality | `{{status}} == 'approved'` |
| `!=` | Inequality | `{{status}} != 'pending'` |
| `and` | Both must be true | `{{a}} == 'x' and {{b}} == 'y'` |
| `or` | Either can be true | `{{a}} == 'x' or {{b}} == 'y'` |

### Variable References

Variables use the same `{{variable}}` syntax as prompt templates:

```yaml
# Simple variable
condition: "{{status}} == 'approved'"

# Nested access
condition: "{{report.severity}} == 'critical'"

# From step output
condition: "{{analysis_result}} != 'failed'"
```

### String Literals

String values must be quoted with single or double quotes:

```yaml
# Single quotes
condition: "{{status}} == 'approved'"

# Double quotes
condition: '{{status}} == "approved"'
```

### Boolean Logic

Combine conditions with `and` / `or`:

```yaml
# Both conditions must be true
condition: "{{security_passed}} == 'true' and {{tests_passed}} == 'true'"

# Either condition can be true
condition: "{{severity}} == 'critical' or {{severity}} == 'high'"

# Chained conditions (evaluated left to right)
condition: "{{a}} == 'x' and {{b}} == 'y' or {{c}} == 'z'"
```

**Note:** Operator precedence is left-to-right. For complex conditions, break into multiple steps.

### Error Handling

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| Condition evaluates to `true` | Execute step normally |
| Condition evaluates to `false` | Skip step, continue to next |
| Undefined variable | **Fail recipe** with clear error message |
| Invalid syntax | **Fail recipe** with parse error |

**Example error:**
```
Step 'critical-fix' condition error: Undefined variable in condition: {{missing}}.
Available: severity, analysis, report
```

### Session State

Skipped steps are tracked in session state:

```json
{
  "skipped_steps": [
    {
      "id": "critical-fix",
      "reason": "condition evaluated to false",
      "condition": "{{severity}} == 'critical'"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Complete Example

```yaml
name: "conditional-code-review"
description: "Review with conditional fixes based on severity"
version: "1.0.0"

context:
  file_path: "src/auth.py"

steps:
  - id: "analyze"
    agent: "analyzer"
    prompt: "Analyze {{file_path}} for issues"
    output: "analysis"

  - id: "critical-fix"
    condition: "{{analysis.severity}} == 'critical'"
    agent: "fixer"
    prompt: "Fix critical issues in {{file_path}}: {{analysis.issues}}"
    output: "fixes"

  - id: "high-priority-review"
    condition: "{{analysis.severity}} == 'high' or {{analysis.severity}} == 'critical'"
    agent: "reviewer"
    prompt: "Review high-priority issues: {{analysis}}"
    output: "review"

  - id: "report"
    agent: "reporter"
    prompt: |
      Generate report:
      Analysis: {{analysis}}
      Fixes: {{fixes}}
      Review: {{review}}
```

### Deferred Features

These operators are not yet implemented but may be added based on need:

- Numeric comparisons: `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
- Negation: `not`
- String functions: `.contains()`, `.startswith()`, `.endswith()`
- Parentheses for grouping

---

## Looping and Iteration

Steps with a `foreach` field iterate over a list variable, executing the step once per item.

### Basic Syntax

```yaml
- id: "process-each"
  foreach: "{{items}}"     # Variable containing list
  as: "current_item"       # Loop variable name (default: "item")
  agent: "processor"
  prompt: "Process {{current_item}}"
  collect: "all_results"   # Aggregates iteration results
```

### How It Works

1. **Resolve `foreach` variable** → Must be a list
2. **For each item** in list:
   - Set loop variable (`as`) to current item
   - Substitute variables in prompt
   - Execute step (spawn agent)
   - Add result to collect list (if `collect` specified)
3. **After all iterations**:
   - Remove loop variable from context (scope ends)
   - Store collected results (if `collect` specified)

### Variable Scoping

```yaml
steps:
  - id: "process"
    foreach: "{{files}}"
    as: "current_file"
    prompt: "Process {{current_file}}"  # current_file available here
    output: "result"
    collect: "all_results"

  - id: "summary"
    prompt: "Summarize {{all_results}}"  # all_results available
    # current_file NOT available here (loop-scoped)
```

**Scope rules:**
- Loop variable (`as`) only available within the loop step
- `collect` variable available after loop completes
- Step `output` is the LAST iteration result (if not using `collect`)

### Error Handling (Fail-Fast)

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| `foreach` variable is list | Iterate over each item |
| `foreach` variable is empty list | Skip step (no error) |
| `foreach` variable is not list | **Fail recipe** with clear error |
| `foreach` variable undefined | **Fail recipe** with clear error |
| Iteration exceeds `max_iterations` | **Fail recipe** with limit error |
| Any iteration fails | **Fail recipe** immediately |

**Rationale:** Fail fast and visibly during development. Silent partial failures hide bugs. If partial completion is needed later, that can be added.

### Parallel Iteration

Add `parallel: true` to run all iterations concurrently:

```yaml
- id: "multi-perspective-analysis"
  foreach: "{{perspectives}}"
  as: "perspective"
  collect: "analyses"
  parallel: true  # Run all iterations simultaneously
  agent: "zen-architect"
  prompt: "Analyze from {{perspective}} perspective"
```

**Behavior with `parallel: true`:**
- All iterations start at the same time
- Results collected in input order (regardless of completion order)
- If ANY iteration fails, entire step fails (fail-fast)
- Significantly faster for independent analyses (~Nx speedup for N items)

**When to use parallel:**
- Independent analyses (security, performance, quality scans)
- Perspectives that don't depend on each other
- When order of execution doesn't matter

**When NOT to use parallel:**
- Iterations that depend on previous results
- Rate-limited APIs (may hit limits)
- Very large lists (spawns all at once)

**Default:** `parallel: false` (sequential iteration, as documented above)

### Interaction with Conditions

```yaml
- id: "process-if-needed"
  condition: "{{should_process}} == 'true'"  # Check BEFORE loop
  foreach: "{{files}}"
  as: "file"
  prompt: "Process {{file}}"
  collect: "results"
```

**Behavior:** Condition evaluated once. If false, entire loop skipped.

### Complete Example

```yaml
name: "batch-file-analyzer"
description: "Analyze multiple files and synthesize results"
version: "1.0.0"

context:
  directory: "src"

steps:
  - id: "discover-files"
    agent: "explorer"
    prompt: "List all Python files in {{directory}}"
    output: "files"

  - id: "analyze-each"
    foreach: "{{files}}"
    as: "current_file"
    agent: "analyzer"
    prompt: |
      Analyze {{current_file}} for:
      - Code complexity
      - Security issues
      - Performance concerns
    collect: "file_analyses"

  - id: "synthesize"
    agent: "zen-architect"
    mode: "ANALYZE"
    prompt: |
      Synthesize these individual file analyses into overall findings:

      {{file_analyses}}

      Prioritize by severity and provide actionable recommendations.
    output: "final_report"
```

### Edge Cases

1. **Empty list**: Skip step, no error (common case)
2. **Single item list**: Works like normal step (minimal overhead)
3. **Very large list**: Respect `max_iterations` (default 100)
4. **Nested variable in foreach**: `{{results.files}}` should work
5. **Loop variable shadows context**: Local scope takes precedence
6. **Condition + foreach**: Condition checked once, not per iteration

### Deferred Features

These features may be added based on real usage needs:

- `continue_on_error` - partial completion on failures
- Checkpointing/resumability for long loops
- Nested loops (`nested_foreach`)
- Index variable (`index_as`)
- Early termination (`break_if`)

---

## Recipe Composition

Recipe composition allows recipes to invoke other recipes as sub-workflows. This enables modular, reusable workflow components.

### Basic Syntax

```yaml
- id: "run-sub-recipe"
  type: "recipe"
  recipe: "path/to/sub-recipe.yaml"
  context:
    variable_name: "{{parent_variable}}"
  output: "sub_result"
```

### How It Works

1. **Parent recipe** encounters a `type: "recipe"` step
2. **Context is prepared** - Only explicitly passed variables are included
3. **Sub-recipe loads** - Recipe file is parsed and validated
4. **Sub-recipe executes** - Runs with isolated context
5. **Results return** - Sub-recipe's final context becomes the step's output
6. **Parent continues** - Output available via `output` variable

### Context Isolation

**Critical design principle:** Sub-recipes receive ONLY the context explicitly passed to them.

```yaml
# Parent recipe
context:
  file_path: "src/auth.py"
  api_key: "secret-123"      # Sensitive - should NOT leak

steps:
  - id: "security-audit"
    type: "recipe"
    recipe: "security-audit.yaml"
    context:
      target: "{{file_path}}"  # Only this is passed
    output: "audit_result"
    # api_key is NOT available to sub-recipe
```

**Why context isolation?**
- Prevents accidental exposure of sensitive data
- Makes sub-recipes predictable (same inputs → same outputs)
- Enables testing sub-recipes in isolation
- Follows security principle of least privilege

### Recursion Protection

Recipe composition includes built-in protection against runaway recursion.

**Limits (configurable via `recursion` field):**
- `max_depth`: Maximum nesting depth (default: 5, range: 1-20)
- `max_total_steps`: Maximum steps across all recipes (default: 100, range: 1-1000)

**Example configuration:**
```yaml
name: "orchestrator"
recursion:
  max_depth: 10        # Allow deep nesting
  max_total_steps: 200 # Allow more total steps
```

**Step-level override:**
```yaml
- id: "deep-analysis"
  type: "recipe"
  recipe: "analysis.yaml"
  recursion:
    max_depth: 3  # Override for this specific invocation
```

**Error on limit exceeded:**
```
RecursionError: Recipe recursion depth 6 exceeds limit 5.
Recipe stack: main.yaml → sub1.yaml → sub2.yaml → sub3.yaml → sub4.yaml → sub5.yaml
```

### Complete Example

**Main recipe (code-review.yaml):**
```yaml
name: "comprehensive-code-review"
description: "Multi-stage review with reusable sub-recipes"
version: "1.0.0"

context:
  file_path: ""

recursion:
  max_depth: 5
  max_total_steps: 150

steps:
  - id: "security-audit"
    type: "recipe"
    recipe: "audits/security-audit.yaml"
    context:
      target_file: "{{file_path}}"
      severity_threshold: "high"
    output: "security_findings"

  - id: "performance-audit"
    type: "recipe"
    recipe: "audits/performance-audit.yaml"
    context:
      target_file: "{{file_path}}"
    output: "performance_findings"

  - id: "synthesize"
    agent: "zen-architect"
    prompt: |
      Synthesize findings:
      Security: {{security_findings}}
      Performance: {{performance_findings}}
    output: "final_report"
```

**Sub-recipe (audits/security-audit.yaml):**
```yaml
name: "security-audit"
description: "Focused security analysis"
version: "1.0.0"

context:
  target_file: ""
  severity_threshold: "medium"

steps:
  - id: "scan"
    agent: "security-guardian"
    prompt: "Scan {{target_file}} for vulnerabilities at {{severity_threshold}} severity"
    output: "scan_results"

  - id: "classify"
    agent: "security-guardian"
    prompt: "Classify findings: {{scan_results}}"
    output: "classified_findings"
```

### Interaction with Other Features

**With conditions:**
```yaml
- id: "optional-deep-scan"
  condition: "{{needs_deep_scan}} == 'true'"
  type: "recipe"
  recipe: "deep-scan.yaml"
  context:
    target: "{{file_path}}"
```

**With foreach:**
```yaml
- id: "audit-each-file"
  foreach: "{{files}}"
  as: "current_file"
  type: "recipe"
  recipe: "single-file-audit.yaml"
  context:
    file: "{{current_file}}"
  collect: "all_audits"
```

**With parallel:**
```yaml
- id: "parallel-audits"
  foreach: "{{audit_types}}"
  as: "audit_type"
  parallel: true
  type: "recipe"
  recipe: "{{audit_type}}-audit.yaml"
  context:
    target: "{{file_path}}"
  collect: "audit_results"
```

### Error Handling

Sub-recipe errors propagate to the parent:
- If a step in sub-recipe fails, the sub-recipe step fails
- Parent recipe's error handling applies (`on_error` field)
- Error messages include the recipe stack for debugging

```yaml
- id: "risky-audit"
  type: "recipe"
  recipe: "experimental-audit.yaml"
  context:
    target: "{{file_path}}"
  on_error: "continue"  # Don't fail parent if sub-recipe fails
```

### Best Practices

1. **Keep sub-recipes focused** - Single responsibility, reusable
2. **Document context requirements** - Clear about what variables are expected
3. **Use meaningful outputs** - Name outputs descriptively
4. **Set appropriate limits** - Adjust recursion limits based on workflow needs
5. **Test sub-recipes independently** - Each should work on its own
